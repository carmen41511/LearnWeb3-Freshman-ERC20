## Build my own token using ERC-20 tokens

In this project, I learned how to create and deploy an ERC-20 token on Ethereum to build my own cryptocurrency

I used Metamask and Remix IDE for this project.

Key steps are:
1. Import the ERC20 contract
2. Define your contract inheriting from ERC20
3. Define a constructor passing name and symbol to the ERC20 constructor
4. Mint tokens to the deployer
5. Compile and deploy
6. Interact with the deployed contract
7. Add the contract to MetaMask
